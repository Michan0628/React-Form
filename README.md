# Multi-Step React Form
This is a simple React form. I used [React Hook Form](https://github.com/Michan0628/React-Form.git) and [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to manage and store state for two forms across the application. The animation of the transition between each pages is created by [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
